# RSA
# The objective is to implement the RSA cryptosystem using the algorithm stated in the research paper provided. The RSA cryptosystem was designed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1978. It is one of the best-known public key cryptosystems for key exchange or digital signatures or encryption of blocks of data. 
RSA uses a variable size encryption block and a variable size key. It is an asymmetric (public key) cryptosystem based on number theory, which is a block cipher system. It uses two prime numbers to generate the public and private keys. These two different keys are used for encryption and decryption purpose. The sender encrypts the message using the receiver public key and when the message gets transmitted to the receiver, then the receiver can decrypt it using his own private key.
